// Array/object/function-typed required props can't be passed as HTML attributes, and can't be
// patched onto an already-mounted element either: a custom element present in the static HTML
// upgrades (and does its first Vue render) the instant the page is parsed, before this deferred
// module runs — a required prop still undefined at that first render throws. `mount()` (from
// this package's own helpers, dogfooded here) creates each element, sets its properties, and
// only then appends it into its placeholder <div> from this page's HTML — see the package
// README's "Known limitations" section.
